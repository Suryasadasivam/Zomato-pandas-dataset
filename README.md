Pandas is a Python package designed to handle relational or labeled data with ease and flexibility. It provides fast and efficient data structures for practical data analysis tasks, making it a fundamental tool for Python developers.

**Key Features**
- Handling Missing Data: Easily manage missing data represented as NaN, NA, or NaT.
- Size Mutability: Insert or delete columns from DataFrame and higher-dimensional objects.
- Automatic Data Alignment: Objects can be explicitly aligned to a set of labels or automatically aligned during computations.
- Powerful Group By: Perform split-apply-combine operations for aggregating and transforming datasets.
- Data Conversion: Convert ragged and differently-indexed data into DataFrame objects effortlessly.
- Label-Based Slicing: Slice, index, and subset large datasets based on labels.
- Merging and Joining: Intuitively merge and join datasets.
- Reshaping and Pivoting: Flexibly reshape and pivot datasets.
- Hierarchical Labeling: Label axes hierarchically with multiple labels per tick.
- IO Tools: Robust tools for loading and saving data from various sources, including flat files, Excel files, databases, and HDF5 format.
- Time Series Functionality: Date range generation, frequency conversion, moving window statistics, date shifting, and lagging for time series data.
